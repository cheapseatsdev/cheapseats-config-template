# Your Cheap Seats: the app, pinned to a release, with this repo as its config. Dependabot opens a pull
# request when a new release is out; review its release notes and the plan in its checks, then
# merge to upgrade. The digest pins the exact image, so a re-pushed tag can't change what you run;
# Dependabot updates the tag and the digest together.
